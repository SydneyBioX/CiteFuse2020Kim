# CiteFuse2020Kim

This repository contains scripts to reproduce all figures in our CiteFuse manuscript. The code is wholly performed in R, and each script is written to be self-contained.

Note that due to the large file size of the files, they have not been included within the repository, but can be downloded from http://www.maths.usyd.edu.au/u/yingxinl/wwwnb/CiteFuse/data.zip.
