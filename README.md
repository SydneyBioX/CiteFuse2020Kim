# CiteFuse2020Kim

CiteFuse is a streamlined package consisting of a suite of tools for pre-processing, modality integration, clustering, differential RNA and ADT expression analysis, ADT evaluation, ligand-receptor interaction analysis, and interactive web-based visualization of CITE-seq data.

This repository contains scripts to reproduce all figures in our CiteFuse manuscript (https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/854299v1). The code is wholly performed in R, and each script is written to be self-contained.

Note that due to the large file size of the files, they have not been included within the repository, but can be downloded from http://www.maths.usyd.edu.au/u/yingxinl/wwwnb/CiteFuse/data.zip.
